# Style Guide: Publications
## All sections
  - Indent with two spaces
  - Use double quotes for all string entries

# Title
- Only bold the first word and proper nouns
- Do not include a period at the end of the article title

# Authors
- Bold lab member names using the following format: **Last FM**
- Use one pair of double asterisks when multiple Fraser lab members appear sequentially: **Young ID, Diaz RE, Liu LL**
- Use &#42; to add an asterisk denoting co-first/corresponding author. Otherwise, bolding of names using **Surname FM** will break.
- Do not include a period at the end of the author list

# Images and PDFs
- All images and PDFs should be named using the following convention: "FirstAuthorSurname_YYYY"
- Leave PMID and PMCID blank until an ID is assigned.
- Remove any sections that are not relevant to your publication (PDB, data, Zenodo, Github repo, etc).
