description: "Francesco is originally from [Cuneo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneo), a beautiful small town in Northwest Italy's Alps. He did his bachelor's and master's in Bioengineering at Politecnico di Torino, where he developed a strong interest in molecular modeling.


In 2014, he moved to Alberta, Canada, to do a Ph.D. in computational physics at the University of Alberta, under the supervision of [Jack Tuszynski](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=vQh8WdcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Khaled Barakat](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j-f21_sAAAAJ&hl=en). During his Ph.D., he worked on discovering and designing small molecule inhibitors of DNA repair proteins that could enhance cancer chemotherapy. His research was primarly supported by an [Alberta Innovates graduate scholarship](https://albertainnovates.ca/funding/graduate-student-scholarships/).


In 2019, Francesco moved to Vancouver, B.C., to work as postdoc in the lab of [Art Cherkasov](https://www.prostatecentre.com/about-us/people/dr-art-cherkasov) at the Vancouver Prostate Centre. There, he developed novel machine learning methods for structure-based virtual screening and used them to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and key proteins involved in resistant prostate and breast cancer. His postdoctoral research was supported by an [Ermenegildo Zegna Founder's Scholarship](https://www.zegnagroup.com/en/our-actions/founders-scholarship/), a [CIHR fellowship](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/38886.html), and a joint fellowship from [Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research]( https://healthresearchbc.ca/fundingprogram/research-trainee-program) and [Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute/ VGH & UBC Hospital Foundation](https://vghfoundation.ca/).


In August 2022, Francesco joined the Department of Chemistry and BIomolecular Sciences as Assistant Professor. Since 2023, he is also a Principal Investigator at the Ottawa Institute for Systems BIology.


Outside the lab, he enjoys playing basketball, biking, fishing, and traveling around the world."
