description: "Yasaman earned her B.Sc. in Computer Science from Alzahra University, Tehran. She then completed her MSc in Computer Science with a focus on AI at uOttawa. For her Master's research, she developed a self-training, semi-supervised model for an online machine learning-based intrusion detection system, crucial for adapting to evolving cyber threats with limited labeled data.
During her Master's, she gained hands-on experience with machine learning project life cycles, deep learning architectures, natural language processing, and strategies for handling imbalanced data.
In her free time, Yasaman enjoys long walks in nature and learning the violin."
