position: "Volunteer Student, Biopharmaceutical Sciences"
description: "I have two years of python and one year of ML experience, with previous research experience in ML model development for assessing the performances of Metal-Organic-Frameworks (MOFs) at the Woo Lab, as a part of an undergraduate thesis project. Recent experience lies in database curation, including exploratory data analysis in PowerBI and excel for the purpose of integrating ML in chemical toxicology analyses at Health Canada. 
Current experience lies in deployment of local LLMs to build a multi-node agentic AI in Python, aiming to help assess and document toxicities of New Substances notified to Health Canada. This project was a student initiative and co-led by another student and myself, and focuses on automating parts of the data collection process within the Environmental Assessment Unit 1 (EAU1). Away from my computer, I like to play badminton and volunteer, as well as oil painting and reading."
