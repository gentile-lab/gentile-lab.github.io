description: "Sumin graduated from Earlham College with a degree in Chemistry. In her undergraduate research, she studied thermodynamic properties of polar fluids using molecular dynamics simulation and molecular-based equation of states. She was also involved in research to study the diffusion in lipid bilayer membranes, especially the effect of periodic boundary conditions in molecular dynamics simulation. Outside of lab, Sumin enjoys going to the gym and exploring the city/nature on a bike."
